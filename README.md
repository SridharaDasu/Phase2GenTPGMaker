# Phase2GenTPGMaker

To build and run the program you need to make sure that you have also
cloned https://github.com/SridharaDasu/mkdep_makefile.git have created
lib and bin directories in your $HOME, set the environment variable
for $PYTHIA8DATA and put the $HOME/bin in your path.

One trick to get $PYTHIA8DATA set, is to simply cmsenv in any recent
CMSSW area that you have.

You can then run makePhase2TPGsFromPythia
